      <h2>How we make money</h2>
      <hr>
      <div>
          <p>TMS (The Millennial Source Ltd.) is a privately held company with journalists, editors and
              marketers around the world. We make money through advertising. More specifically, our
              advertising revenue comes in the following forms:</p>
          <div class="about-make-money">
              <h4>Affiliate advertising partnerships: </h4>
              <p>These are advertising partnerships between us and companies
                  non-for-profits. After meeting their management and marketing team, we test their product
                  and
                  profile their company and provide an honest account of both. If you make a purchase of their
                  product through our platform, we earn a commission.
                  Content that is sponsored by an affiliate partner is clearly labeled as such.</p>

              <h4>Advertising partners:</h4>
              <p>These are highly-curated advertising partnerships between us and a very
                  limited amount of businesses that we feel strongly have a product, purpose and values that
                  align
                  with ours and that youâ€™ll enjoy. We earn a fee in exchange for this publicity. And again,
                  content that is sponsored by an advertising partner is clearly labeled as such.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Content that is sponsored by an advertising partner will be clearly labeled as such. Our
              editorial departments intentionally operate independent to our B2B division with no personnel
              crossover. We vet our advertising partners through numerous questionnaires and interviews with
              our specialist team to ensure there is an alignment in interest and values between us, you and
              them. This phase is never missed and our requirements are never compromised. </p>
